# Web Development Lab 5 - *DYYP LITE*

Submitted by: **Peyton Adkins**

This web app: **This is a desktop version of a previously existing iOS application DYYP. In actuality, this is a web app for reading cryptocurrency data from an API, similar to that of an existing project I had worked on in the Fall of 2022.**

Time spent: **5.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **User can view a list of at least 30 cryptocurrencies, including the image, name, and price of the coin in US dollars**
- [X] **User can search for a specific coin in the list of cryptocurrencies by symbol**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can view a list of cryptocurrency scams on a separate pane in the page

## Notes

I ran into an API limit midway through development, having to use the email of my webcomic to continue. This lab was very straightforward, but due to the amount of time I had spent in my other course, I did not implement many of the features I had wanted, such as popups for user-friendly displays for loading and the inclusion of DYYPER, the fun mascot I had in mind.

Fortunately with this particular lab, it was quite reminiscent of a past assignment for Mobile iOS Development, something Dr. J taught in fact. My group designed a small app that too used a coin API to show coins in a list format. This app was called DYYP, and I intended to utilize the assets I had created before in order to make a fun callback to that assignment. I call it “DYYP Desktop!”
